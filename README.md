## The [WENS](https://wens.kumoh.ac.kr/) is a  Wireless and Emerging Network System Laboratory at the [Kumoh National Institute of Technology](https://eng.kumoh.ac.kr/) in the Republic of Korea (South Korea). 

### Our research interests include signal processing, algorithm, protocol, and application of the wireless network & communication. Such as 
* Radio access technologies (RAT) for Beyond B5G/6G and Future Radio Access
* Unmanned Every Vehicle (UxV) such UAV, UGV, UUV, USV 
* Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning  
* Augmented reality, Mixed reality 
* Embedded System / Internet of Things
* Wearable device & computing
* Wired/wireless network application   
### but not limited.
